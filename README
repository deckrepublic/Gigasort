README for Tyler Decker's Gigasort program


csu id: 829466072

unsorted data set: unsorted-2
with 16 reducers


I have a problem with my output, I have 16 reducers in my job but my output is only writing to 8 files. When I look at the job summary after the job finishes it states that 8 reducer jobs have been killed.
This never seemed to happen when I was testing my program locally. The output from the finished job ran from shared cluster shown below:

I have no idea why my program is doing this and have no clue on how to approach it. Maybe would have had time to figure it out but I had that connection issue with the shared cluster tht you helped me figure out
I have just generated a merkle tree from the 8 files that were written.
here is the hash code: c1c459c4ad3a815e5f886bea5e39d59907065ce8

Here is my output file system:
